We combine molecular and cellular virology, next-generation sequencing and computational biology to study well-controlled and highly characterized model systems such as Flock House virus, as well as human pathogens including chikungunya virus, zika virus, coronaviruses and HIV. We study systems ranging from controlled cell culture, through animal models, into clinical specimens. This multi-strata approach is aimed at gaining a moleculeâ€™s-eye view of the mechanisms of RNA replication and recombination in order to understand virus evolution on a population scale.
